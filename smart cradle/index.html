        </h5><br><br>
      

      <section class="feature-sec">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Is an IOT project as we know to be learn IOT is internet of things which is designer to gave 
          time and for making work easy and accurate. As for as time and security is concerned with the 
          help of IOT he will build a cradle system which will make stress free and most important it will 
          be safe and Secure for the baby. So managing the work in time and taking care of maybe is very 
          important factor. Cradle system will give parents required time to Parent for rest as is the parents 
          both mother and father goes for the job or even if the mother is house wife. Being stress free will 
          definitely create the great atmosphere which will make great atmosphere around the baby. So it 
          doesn't matter if there is no one to swing cradle it will do swing automatically if the baby is 
          crying. It doesn't matter if baby based on p and no on nose about for long time but not need to 
          worry cradle system will also give the Alert about the witness in cradle. This cradle system will 
          help the parents so they can take good care of their baby. The modules in cradle system for 
          which anyone will be operated after any kinds of situation that are given as follows:
          If the baby is making noise or baby is crying then some sense or will be here that frequency and 
          it will start swing also alert message will send to Parent through the blink app if the baby bad 
          wetted the mattresses of the cradle then alert message will send to Parent through the blink app.</p>

       <p class="Explaination" style="text-align: justify;">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Parents might not have the time to soothe their baby to sleep or rock their baby back to sleep in 
          the middle of the night. Studies about the effect of rocking a baby have been carried out and 
          found that babies sleep better while being rocked or swung lightly because the rhythmic 
          movement mimics the gentle rocking they felt while in their mothers’ womb. Most available 
          automated cradles aredesign ed to rock non-stop. However, the rocking movement can make the 
          baby nauseous and uncomfortable. Thus, allowing the automated cradle to rock the baby to sleep 
          in the middle of the night is also a problem. Furthermore, some parents place their baby in a 
          separate room. Therefore, parents could not hear the baby crying and could not be there to ease 
          their baby back to sleep in the middle of the night. Other parents may be occupied with house 
          chores. Thus, because they cannot hear their baby crying, they cannot attend to them 
          immediately. Sometimes, the baby only needs a little distraction to return to deep sleep. Several 
          types of baby cradles are available in stores, but they are expensive, and not everyone can afford 
          them. In addition, the existing automatic cradles in the literature have many limitations in terms 
          of functionality, cost, and communication technology support </p><br><br>

        
          <h3>FLowchart</h3>
          <br><p style="text-align: justify;">The flowchart of the general work flow of the baby monitoring system. The NodeMCU had to 
            be connected to the pre-set Wi-Fi network when power of the microcontroller is turned on. The 
            buzzer rings for 1 second to indicate that the microcontroller is connected to the Wi-Fi network. 
            The user must access the Internet via their mobile phone/laptop to monitor and control the smart 
            cradle. Then, the user has to run applications for MQTT Dash or wireless camera. The system 
            starts working by checking the detection of sound through the sound sensor. The measured 
            reading might fluctuate due to wind or noise. Hence, a range of threshold values was set for the 
            fluctuation detection. When the baby’s cry is detected, the measured value exceeds the threshold 
            value, and the cradle is swung by turning on the Relay 1 connected to the DC geared motor either 
            automatically or manually.</p><br>
